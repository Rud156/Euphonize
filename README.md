# Euphonize
> Boilerplate and Basic Functioning for WebApp

##### Initial start time might be long as I'm using the free tier of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which switches off servers after 30 mins of non use

### Work In Progress

### Data Persistance
- Data persistance is achieved by storing your playlists in the LocalStorage.
- ⚠️ Beware if the LocalStorage is cleared your playlists are also cleared.
- To save your playlists permanently use the Share Playlist option and keep the ID received safely.
- These can then be restored anytime you want via the ID received
